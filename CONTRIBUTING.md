If you'd like to contribute to the project, first of all: Thank you!
At the moment we have some options already.

## Create an issue

You are using the [Processing()](https://github.com/NoOrientationProgramming/ProcessingCore) structure and encountered something strange you did not expect?
If you think this is a bug then please do not hesitate to create an issue. We will then check the situation.
Try to make a clear description of
- How to reproduce the behavior
  - Used hardware
  - Involved processes
  - Inputs
  - etc.
- The expectation
- The result

## Open a discussion

If you want to share something else with us, like a question, an idea or
other stuff you can also open a discussion
in the [Discussions](https://github.com/NoOrientationProgramming/ProcessingTutorials/discussions) page of this repository.
We would be very pleased to see one of your projects using the Processing() structure as well!
